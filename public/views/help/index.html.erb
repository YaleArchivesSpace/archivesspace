<div id="search">
	<h2>How do I search for materials?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin a basic search by entering your search terms in the search bar. You may limit the search by searchable fields, record type, and date.</li>
    <li>The searchable fields are:
      <ul>
        <li>Keyword: Searches the entire text of the finding aid.</li>
        <li>Title: Searches titles of the materials described, including collection records and series and files within collections. If you know the precise title of the thing you’re looking for, searching by title can be very helpful.</li>
        <li>Creator: Searches names of the persons, families, and organizations who created the collections.</li>
        <li>Subject: Searches by subject headings assigned to materials by archivists and librarians, e.g. United States history.</li>
        <li>Call Number: Searches by identifier, which is a unique number by which materials are tracked and requested.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Record types allow you to customize the type of records you want a search to return:
      <ul>
        <li>Limit to collections will only return records for collections, rather than people, subjects, series, and files.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You may select a date span to limit the search results chronologically. Searching by date is approximate, and results may fall outside the date span you enter.</li>
    <li>You may construct a more complex search by selecting the + icon and adding additional search parameters.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="advanced">
	<h2>What should I know about phrasing my searches?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Searches are not case sensitive.</li>
    <li>You may search for phrases by including quotation marks (e.g. “Berkeley College”)</li>
    <li>By default, searches with three or fewer search terms return results containing all of the search terms. Searches with four or more search terms return results containing most of the search terms. You may add OR and NOT to change this behavior (e.g. Stiles OR Morse or art NOT British).</li>
    <li>You may add a tilde (~) to search for search terms within a specified number of words of one another (e.g. “maps Asia”~5 will return results where the term maps occurs within 5 words of the term Asia).</li>
    <li>“Wildcard” symbols ? and * help return a greater number of relevant results by searching for variant spellings and forms of search terms simultaneously.
      <ul>
        <li>? replaces a single letter in a search term (e.g. searching wom?n will return both women and woman, and searching archiv? will return both archive and archivy)</li>
        <li>* replaces any number of letters at the end of a search term (e.g. searching mission* will return mission, missions, missionary, and missionaries) </li>
        <li>? and * may <strong>not</strong> be used as the first character of a word. </li>
        <li>To use a wildcard in combination with another search term (e.g. wom?n suffrage), use the + icon to create another row and enter each search term in a separate row.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="filter">
	<h2>How can I filter my search results?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Once you’ve done a search and are on the search results page, you can use the filter pane on the left side of the page to further limit and customize search results.</li>
    <li>You may use the filter pane to filter by repository, record type, subject, and name.</li>
    <li>You may also use the search bar at the top of the filter pane to create additional searches within the search results.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="navigate">
	<h2>How do I navigate the site?</h2>
    <p>To begin a search, use the search bar on the home page.</p>

<div id="repositories">
	<h2>Which repositories are included in Archives at Yale?</h2>
	<p>Archives at Yale includes finding aids from 10 repositories at Yale University:</p>

    <li><a href="/repositories/11">Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library</a></li>
    <li><a href="/repositories/12">Manuscripts and Archives</a></li>
    <li><a href="/repositories/10">Medical Historical Library, Harvey Cushing / John Hay Whitney Medical Library</a></li>
    <li><a href="/repositories/8">Lewis Walpole Library</a></li>
    <li><a href="/repositories/3">Yale Center for British Art, Institutional Archives</a></li>
    <li><a href="/repositories/2">Yale Center for British Art, Rare Books and Manuscripts</a></li>

    <li><a href="/repositories/4">Yale University Divinity School Library</a></li>
    <li><a href="/repositories/6">Yale University Music Library</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each repository has its own location, hours, and policies for providing access to its collections. Please consult the repository with questions about using the materials.</p>
</div>

<div id="holding_repository">
	<h2>How do I know which repository holds a collection?</h2>
  <p>When you’ve done a search and are on the search results page, the “found in” breadcrumb trail at the bottom of each search result indicates which repository holds the collection.</p>
  <img src="assets/images/foundinrepobreadcrumbsearchresults.png" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius: 4px;padding: 5px; width:65%; height:auto;margin:1em 0 3em 0;" alt="A snapshot of a single search result in Archives at Yale, with the Found In section highlighted to indicate the holding repository for that particular collection."/>
  <p>When you’re viewing a record, the breadcrumb trail at the top of the page indicates which repository holds the collection.</p>
  <img src="assets/images/foundinrepobreadcrumbcollection.png" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius: 4px;padding: 5px; width:65%; height:auto; margin:1em 0 3em 0;" alt="An image of a finding aid in Archives at Yale, with the breadcrumbs section highlighted, which indicate the holding repository for that particular collection."/>
</div>

<div id="request">
	<h2>How do I request materials?</h2>
  <p>To request materials from a collection, select the request button at the top of the page.</p>
  <img src="assets/images/request.png" alt="Request icon in Archives at Yale" style="padding-bottom:1em;"/>
  <p>After you click on the request button:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You will be asked to log into your special collections account or to create an account if you are a new user.</li>
    <li>You will be taken to the request review page, where you should see the item listed, along with any other requests you may have placed in review.</li>
    <li>Check the box next to the item(s) you wish to request.</li>
    <li>Please note the “reading room” and “availability” columns, as they will indicate where the item can be viewed and when it can be made available for your use.</li>
    <li>Select your visitation date based on this information and press the submit request button to send the request to the repository. If you're unsure if you want to immediately order the box, you may leave the request in your queue. Doing so allows you to queue any number of requests without ordering them, important as most repositories allow you to order only ten items per visit.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each repository has its own location, hours, and policies for providing access to its collections. Please consult the repository with questions about using the materials. Collections are non-circulating and must be used in the repository’s reading room. In many cases the collections are stored off-site and require advance notice for retrieval.</p>
  <p>Please note that although the system allows requesting on the item level, you do not need to place multiple requests for items within the same box. For instance, if you want to view Beinecke YCAL MSS 42 Box 52 folders 1542-1547, you should place only a single request for Box 52.</p>
  <p>Note that requesting is not enabled for the Divinity School Library, Peabody Museum of Natural History, or the Yale Center for British Art. To request a research visit to view those materials, please contact the repository.</p>
</div>

<div id="register">
	<h2>How do I register for a special collections account?</h2>
  <p>You will be prompted to create an account after clicking the request button. You may also create an account here: <a href="https://sso.library.yale.edu/ChooseDestination">landing page</a>.</p>
  <p>First, you will be asked to read and accept Yale’s library user agreement. Researchers with a valid Yale NetID can use Yale’s Central Authentication Service (CAS) to register online and create a special collections account. All other researchers must provide a valid email address to complete registration.</p>
  <p>For additional information about registering for an special collections account, including forms of identification you must bring for your first visit, see the <a href="https://guides.library.yale.edu/specialcollections/speccoll-register">Using Special Collections at the Yale University Library registration page</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="yfad">
	<h2>How is this different from YFAD?</h2>
  <p>Some of the biggest changes you may notice include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Searching names and subjects, allowing you to see the collections associated with each name and subject across repositories.</li>
    <li>Searching series, files, and items in addition to collections. Searches may return relevant files from collections you may not have considered otherwise.</li>
    <li>The default search settings return results at the series, file, and item levels as well as the collection level, rather than a list of collections. Staff and other users searching for known items may therefore wish to limit their searches to collections by selecting the record type “collection.”</li>
    <li>Navigating finding aids in multiple “views,” including collection organization context trees, container lists, and a traditional finding aid view. You can also download a fully formatted PDF of a finding aid.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="coverage">
	<h2>Does Archives at Yale include all archival materials at Yale? What if I can’t find what I’m looking for?</h2>

    <li>Small collections and single item manuscripts (such as individual diaries, letters, and sketchbooks). These are cataloged in <a href="https://orbis.library.yale.edu/vwebv/">Orbis</a>, the online catalog of the Yale University Library.</li>
    <li>Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, which are searchable in a separate <a href="http://brbl-net.library.yale.edu/pre1600ms/">database</a> at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library and in <a href="https://orbis.library.yale.edu/vwebv/">Orbis</a>.</li>
    <li>Most unprocessed collections (except for unprocessed recent archival acquisitions from Beinecke Library, which are included).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Digital records</strong> are born-digital and digitized materials that are available online.</p>
  <p><strong>Finding aids</strong> allow users to discover, understand, and access archival collections. Finding aids describe the creation, arrangement, content, and context of archival materials.</p>
  <p><strong>Repositories</strong> are institutions that hold archival materials. Archives at Yale contains finding aids from 10 repositories at Yale University, including libraries, special collections, and museums.</p>
  <p><strong>Name records</strong> are the people, families, and organizations that create archival materials.
